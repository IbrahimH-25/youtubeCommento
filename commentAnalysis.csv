It was published in 1837 . <br>In the original book it say&quot; den yngste var den smukkeste af dem allesammans, hendes hud var saa klar og skjær som et rosenblad, bendes øine saa blåa, som den dybeste sø,<br>(the youngest was the most beautiful one, her skin was so fair and soft like a rose petal, her eyes as blue as the deepest sea.) Another part from original book : never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them, holding out her White hands towards the keel of their ship<br><br>There is even a statue of the little mermaid in Denmark standing in the capital, Copenhagen at the harbor commission in 1909. This statue is so culturally significant to the Danish people and rooted deep in the culture, that for the EXPO in 2010 it was decided to relocate &quot; the little mermaid&quot;. The statue was relocated to Shanghai to be placed in the Denmark pavilion at the EXPO, it was a huge expense to do it, but they wanted to show their cultural heritage.<br><br>To make it short. The little mermaid is both historically and culturally significant character for Denamrk, with a very long history and has been seen all over the world. Because of the history behind the story my prediction for this movie will be bad in most of Europe, but far worse in the Scandinavian countries.<br><br>The skin color of the actress is not the issue, it is Disney Americanization of European culture that is being pushed at the Europeans, this is why Euro Disney wasn&#39;t liked in Europe but really despised when it opened. Euro Disney was rebranded and huge cultural changes of the park operation and designs to not offend the Europeans.<br><br>Before you all get your panties in a twist and say the movie is not the same, Disney did acknowledge the statue and the culture of Denmark by adding the pose of the statue in the movie. Add to it, the script from 1930 that Disney did but also the notes and changes by H.C Andersen. Not to mention right before the exit of the little mermaid ride at Disney California Adventure Park, be on the lookout for a tribute to the Little Mermaid’s original author, Hans Christian Andersen but also Copenhagen&#39;s famous Little Mermaid Statue ( Den Lille Havfrue)<br><br>This is very American - centric to ignore the deep cultural and historical affection ingrained in European cultures and how this characters are important to Europeans and especially to the Danes.<br><br>You say The Little Mermaid is just a story would be like saying, the Mona Lisa is just a painting or the Coliseum is just a building. They are not just a story, just a painting or just a building. They are deeply tied to the culture and people. Everyone in Europe know that the Little Mermaid is deeply tied to the culture and people of Denmark. <br>By inserting American - centric culture war ideology onto the screen is a huge mistake by Disney. <br>I can guarantee, that the film trailer didn&#39;t earn this many dislikes, the most down voted trailer in American history by US votes only. It is world wide<br><br>This amazing actress is being used as a shield by Disney, any criticism will be classed as racism because they have a black woman in it and not for their own mistake. . <br>All this was lazy work from Disney. Don&#39;t tell me there isn&#39;t a single story, mythology, fairytale, anywhere in any country in Africa. Because there are many. Mami Wata is one of them, a water spirit. They could have easily made a spin on the little mermaid and made Mami Wata a friend of Ariel, that we could see and learn something from African cultures. By making a unique character they could show the life of Ariel&#39;s friend or the friendship between different races, that it is ok to be white, it is ok to be black or why not Gabriella&#39;s own story, she was a dark skinned latina that was deaf and mute but Ariel&#39;s friend ( based on a real person that sadly passed away)<br><br>On a side note: <br>The model for Ariel was Alyssa Milano<br>Ursula&#39;s looks are based on the drag queen Divine.<br><br>Replica of the little mermaid statue<br>Solvang California, installed by Earl and Dolores Peterson in 1976, This is America&#39;s biggest danish settlement and has a substantial tourist industry based on its Danish heritage.

I will give you an example - the new black characters in the new Lord of the Rings series on Amazon prime. I personally believe they are cast intelligently and give the characters depth , fitting them in with the overall story. Yes, should have been done before but now it’s a great step. And more to the point, Does not detract from the story but adds to it. I want to see blacks given the SAME level of priority as white actors, so that there is change and we don’t see colour on screen .

1310,UgzpQilPyBKnUf0nEEt4AaABAg,Xb2FKFL8vJ8,"Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br><br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us into His image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. We cannot purify ourselves, but Christ lived that perfect sinless, pure life and then allotted it to our &quot;account&quot;. <br><br>That&#39;s where our righteousness comes from. Not from any good, works that you or I could do. <br>It is not based on the amount of good works we do. God starts the changes, He carries it on, and He completes it in those who let Him.<br><br>It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him, again, through His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if YOU had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, forgiveness, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus.

Mermaids are known to be demons that beckon sailors to their deaths, which is why Eric is lured by Ariel&#39;s voice. So this mermaid Demon marries a human Eric at the end.<br><br>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-Create a satanic baphomet styled beast to fall in love with a human (bestiality), and introduce LaFou as a homosexual character, to get children dissensitized to it.<br><br>CINDERELLA-Another film that casts the evil character as more beautiful than Cinderella, and tries to make you feel sorry for her (the stepmother) by showing her backstory. Also, they emphasized the demonic look of the human lizard with sharp teeth. <br><br>All these demonic images are inspired by the spirits of the air, so that when kids watch them, they get possessed and become disobedient. Many people who were taken to see space by angels, saw that demons inhabit the spiritual realm right above the earth in space. They can&#39;t live on earth, but they are permitted to descend into the earth. Here&#39;s some testimonies:<br><br>ROCK MUSIC CARTOONS<br><br>&quot;I was a rocker and I really liked the rock music genre. My room was decorated with posters of skulls and plastic skeletons. My t-shirts were monsters and I watched a lot of horror movies. My house was decorated with monster dolls.<br><br>My life was disturbed. I could see shapes all over the house and I was suffering from insomnia. I was scared of these spirits. One of the plastic skeletons started walking and talking to me. The plastic dolls flew in front of me. Objects also flew away leaving me scared. My parents live in the house next door. I was alone seeing that natural phenomenon. The lights went out and went on and then a black smoke filled my room.<br><br>The next day I went to the Catholic church and prayed. I knelt near a saint asking for protection. I heard the saint laughing. I was scared and left the church. I was upset and told my parents everything that happened.<br><br>At night I heard someone call me in the backyard of my house. I went to see what it was. I saw a horrible creature in front of me. This demon had big eyes and looked like an alien. I just remember that a force pulled me at high speed. I was transported to another place, full of trees with no houses. That monster transported me to this place. I had no idea where that was.<br><br>I kept looking for my house stopping people on the street. I spent all night hungry and without money asking for information about my address. Until I found my house in the morning. My parents did not believe what I said.<br><br>That ET-like demon kidnapped me and left me in a place full of trees. People who say they&#39;ve been abducted by UFOs are mocked. I speak to everyone who hears me. Some people who speak these things tell the truth. The problem is they think these creatures are from other planets.<br><br>Extraterrestrials are a class of demons that spread deceit on earth. They appear to people to strengthen ufologist doctrine about the existence of lives on other planets. And when someone goes through the experience that I have passed but has no spiritual discernment, they say that aliens are invading the earth making people believe in these stories.<br><br>People say they were abducted, but the term is not. They were transported to another place as I went. Satan appeared to Jesus in the wilderness and transported Him to the city then took Him to a very high hill. This is not an abduction. The demons in these ends of time are more daring and appearing for the people.<br><br>I was transported to another neighborhood away from home and could be taken to another country. I believe God did not allow them to take me to a place further.<br><br>My parents noticed that I was upset and called the pastor to pray for me. I wanted to be free from all trouble.<br><br>Before my deliverance, the demons used my dog to talk to me and possessed the decorating dolls. Even the plates and glasses of glass were moving. I was an 18-year-old who watched alien movies and drawings as well. I had extraterrestrial magazines. Everything I had was creating life. The pastor arrived at my house and I begged him to free me, I could not stand that traumatic life any longer.<br><br>The spirit of suicide was driving me to kill myself to end that suffering. The pastor prayed for me and my body did not resist and fell. He rebuked that legion that was in my body. When he cast out that evil spirit, the demon left my body and took my soul along.<br><br>This demon took me to hell, while my body was dead to the ground. I was dead, but my soul stayed in hell. Out of my eyes came tears because of the pain and suffering of that place. The pastor was surprised to see my dead body crying.<br><br>He said, &quot;His soul is not in a good place that&#39;s why he cries.&quot; I was in hell with that demon that took me. He looked at me and laughed saying, &quot;I have lived in you for many years. Today you have the opportunity to see me in person. I will introduce you to Satan.<br><br>The demon led me to a black throne. As I approached Satan I began to sound cold and a great fear invaded my soul. He looked at me and said, &quot;There on earth you listened to my songs that were consecrated to me. All the posters of monsters that are in your room, they are pictures of my demons.&quot;<br><br>I was terrified and urinated in fear. As I stood near him my hair began to melt and fall to the ground because of the high negativity in his body.<br><br>Satan said, &quot;My demons cannot be seen on earth and the only way they can be known is through television as in horror movies and monster drawings.&quot;<br><br>Satan said that his demons instructed the Satanists to make films and drawings with their faces.<br><br>I saw infantile demons like the Donald Duck, Sylvester the Cat, Long Legs and Woodpecker. I saw the demons Incredible Hulk, Batman, Spiderman, and Superman. I saw the movie demons like Fredy Krueger and Jason. It was not the writers who invented these movie characters. Before they went to television, they already existed. Only the demons inspired the writers to create their images in the movies. I saw the claws of Fredy Krueger in hell. The demons used to tear the souls apart.&quot;-MARK THOMPSON<br><a href=""http://spiritreports.blogspot.com/2018/09/testimony-of-mark-thompson-of-city-of.html"">http://spiritreports.blogspot.com/2018/09/testimony-of-mark-thompson-of-city-of.html</a>",False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

1700,Ugyup4MVELV5xOxmjsp4AaABAg,Xb2FKFL8vJ8,People always try Insinuate one thing and have hidden underlying biases. And I will also say studying African religion and just cultures all over the world such as China and Europe you will see that all of these cultures had mermaids. I know a lot of people don’t like to believe that there could be such a thing but there is. And also it’s pretty racist to have a Jamaican crab . In the Caribbean Sea and no black mermaids I mean come on. And like I said even if you study Jamaican religion or Haitian religion or just African religion and tails and folktales there’s always mermaids so to me it’s pretty ridiculous when people try to act like a fictional character has a race. Because it’s fictional. Puss in boots is a cat it is fictional it can be a black cat lol It is fictional. Mag understand if we made Queen Elizabeth black that would be wrong historically. How many times have I watched an Egyptian movie and thought wow that’s not historically right. The Ancient Egyptians were blackNo one batted an eye  when the gods of Egyptian were white again and died down …. The prince of Egypt should’ve portrayed all black cartoon characters but instead they were very ambiguous let’s be real.

It was incredible how they did the jungle book and the lion King and Lady and the tramp and even Aladdin.. when they did Mulan and it wasn&#39;t a musical. I was excited how well of a job they did and get excited to see what they would make next ...What a major disappointment when I watched the new Pinocchio..what a big mess. It was all over the place. Then buzz light year? I watched that and was at first confused then shocked.. our children&#39;s young minds at this age is not the place for this... then the preview for the little mermaid.  A timeless classic I loved as a kid and still till this day.. to ask the question to Disney why? Why would you do this? Is this their way again of stirring up controversy? Shame on them. Here im looking to see a beautiful movie brought back to life with the new technology. For a statement piece.. seriously Disney needs to stick to the original story line and bring back a beautiful classic. If they are wanting to create another story line of color and a new hot classic then do so. Stop smashing this nonsense in our kids minds this is wrong is so many ways.<br>As another prime example. Like Starz promoting their power book.. or p- Valley. .. to me it is disgusting how they portray people of color of being nothing but drug addicts junkies thugs and theives..God made us all in his image doesn&#39;t matter our color and this shit like Disney and Starz needs to stop playing that racial bullshit.. shame on them.

It just some folks are highly upset that their favorite childhood cartoon character was replaced by a brown face character. Let me just educate some people of mermaid folklore on a global scale. There are folklores pertaining to mermaids of all colors on every continent. Folklores in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and Central and South America. In Africa, mermaids are called Mami Wata and are considered to be Water spirits. So, Disney just brought out cultural representation of another version of the Little Mermaid.<br><br>People just need to stop with their fake outrage about why they don’t like this trailer and be really honest about how they feel about certain things instead of making up fake conspiracy theories. People of color had to deal with cultural appropriation since the entertainment industry was established. We had to deal with racism in entertainment.. All that people have to do is to go back and rewatch the older Disney cartoons and others to see how cartoonists depicted people of color and kids of color had no characters to really identify with historically in cartoons. Now little Black girls and others can identify with princesses who look like them and people of all races should celebrate this moment for their kids to see the beauty of all people regardless of culture or race. . What is wrong with that? Non-Disney related, does anyone remember the old cartoon Betty Boop? In the cartoon, she was depicted as a Caucasian character. However, that cartoonist modeled the character after Black entertainer named Esther Jones<br><br>But  people want to get pissed off just because people of color finally have their opportunity to have representation in entertainment.

Fun fact, HOLLYWOOD ALWAYS BEEN PANDERING! Demographic is just the fancy term of the word. They pander to women, men, children, nerds and various communities. It’s just we see a rise in roles holding people of color and LGBTQ in the foreground due to their own roaring demographic. Studios don’t care about the people, they only see percentages. I don’t know how hard that is to see for all these grown ass men complaining about a little diversity in things. And so hypothetically, “congratulations! Disney listened to you for some reason and cancelled the film and or changed the actress” you know what they just did there? Pander… <br>Second point, if you even go on about this being woke, gore the hell up. These are PUBLIC DOMAIN stories, the original Disney story didn’t follow the original story so why should this? The tale will be here until we die and beyond. Of course there would be changes if it was a 100% it be boring. Hollywood for decades casted white people in non white roles. Like in the Prince of Persia, Ghost in the Shell, Dr Strange, She Hulk, The Last Airbender, Gods of Egypt, Exodus and every single live action appearance of Rahs Al Goul. Just to name a few. When shit like that happened people were vocal yes, but not as much as people like these are. If you think Disney is going some remember they were all ok on erasing Chadwick Boseman and John Boyega for the Chinese version of the movie’s posters. Going onto a 90 second trailer and giving it 1 million dislikes is hilarious to me, y’all really care that much? Are you going to see the movie? Is it targeted to you? No <br>Third and final point, if you only hate it cause it’s a soulless cash grab than that is OK. Hollywood needs a wake up call or something, cause these reboots are sad and money hungry.

To give you an example, just like Little mermaid, everyone grew up watching Tom and Jerry&#39;s show. Now imagine in the live-action movie they make the color of Tom green and give Jerry a purple color; how would people react? The same was in the next two decades; Universal Pictures make a live-action movie of Despicable Me where the minions are square-shaded with black colors rather than yellow. Will you call people who give negative reviews on these movies racist?<br>I don&#39;t blame Disney if they want to add more diversity, mermaids can be black or green because they are just fictional characters. BUT come up with a new name and a new story. It could be a sequel to Ariel or a prequel to it. A good example where when the new Captain America becomes a black character. They didn&#39;t just make Steve Roger a black male character; instead just introduced a black character who takes on the mantle of Steve and becomes a captain of America himself. You can also see that in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse where spiderman is a black character. Instead of changing the color of Peter parker, they introduce a new black character called Miles Morales, who is a new teenage version of spiderman. People loved that. As a matter of fact, it has one of the highest ratings of all scores. No one has any problem with the skin color of the character.

They say &quot;its just a fictional characther, get over it!&quot; but if it is the other way around (just like the people using AI on twitter to change the trailer and get banned on twitter) they lose their shit and it stops being only a &quot;fictional characther&quot;.<br>It kinda bothers me that if it were them, they would have all the right to show their discontent at it but if WE do it we are automatically racist.

A black can&#39;t make a great hero without stealing the place of a white? &quot;How dare you?!?&quot;<br><br>Speaking for myself, I simply HATE any gender/race swap in remakes, series, spinoffs, etc. This has NOTHING to do with misogynism or racism, it&#39;s a matter of being faithful to the original author, and PERIOD.<br>&quot;Nick Fury&quot;, in comics, was white. He&#39;s black in MCU - WTF? I know that there isn&#39;t a huge amount of black characters in Marvel&#39;s comics, but there is several ones anyway... And also green, blue, gray, red people. You can criticize Marvel for displaying perfect bodies in Spandex suits, but regarding color skin or religion, there is enough for everyone - please also remember that a lot of these characters were created in a time where segregation was still a thing.<br>Last &quot;Dune&quot;: Liet Kynes got both a gender and race swap... The character doesn&#39;t have a lot of lines, for sure, but it one of the keys that started the whole ascension of Paul... And he was also his father-in-law. Hard to explain this link now, unless you twist the novel!<br>And I won&#39;t even detail what they dare to do to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;... You may observe a minute of silence.<br><br>At the same time, I feel obligated to remember to people (yeah, I speak for the two racist rednecks in the back) that Africa is our original cradle... Obviously, they HAVE stories, legends, and so on. A lot of them, in fact... So much that, in France, a (white) guy made three animation movies about a little African boy, Kirikou, extremely clever, extremely small. It&#39;s based on some legends from West Africa. And most Americans never saw it because there is some &quot;nudity&quot; inside - remember, we speak about idealistic village and tribe, in an untold time, threatened by a witch, with living fetishes (idols), and most children are indeed naked. Oh, and you see titties, too, that&#39;s awfully indecent for a country that allows porn stars to be interviewed during prime-time. But drawn titties, in a non-sexualized view of &quot;pure humans&quot;, that&#39;s heresy... 🙄 At least, some black people in USA may had access to these movies through Artmattan. Critics were very good.<br><br>In particular, the African genesis tales are quite original, regarding the ones we already knew... I like the tale of Makulu and the apes, for example, or of Anansi and the wisdom, or the one about Bamako and the creation of the Moon. But this isn&#39;t even the tip of the iceberg: it&#39;s an ice cube dropped in Antarctica.<br>Asian tales and legends are also very rich and complex, and it&#39;s the same near EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. Name a race, they have stories... Some are quite &quot;common&quot;, i.e. we already have very similar ones, but you will ALWAYS find an original one. And, obviously, if you use a Senegalese legend, then you use Senegalese actors (or mixed Senegaleses) to play them, that&#39;s only fair. You can have a whole movie played ONLY by blacks, or asians, or latinos, or whatever race you want, and everything will be fine - and appreciated by people, if there isn&#39;t a stupid gender swap and/or a woke push inside the movie. And all these races can then have their OWN heroes, from THEIR people and culture.<br><br>Then, you can leave our &quot;white&quot; tales and legends be interpreted by who is designed to do it: white people. That&#39;s OUR history, OUR background, OUR legends. There isn&#39;t any place in it for &quot;diversity&quot;, because it was in a time (real or imaginary) where ONLY white people were living in Europe.<br><br>Excepted some woketards / racetards, NOBODY watch a movie because the main actors are white or black or yellow. We don&#39;t care about their color, as long as it is PERTINENT and CONSISTENT. A black Viking? Nonsense. It&#39;s as insulting as a blackface. I like fantastic movies, I don&#39;t care if they are based on asian, africans, europeans tales. &quot;The Three Kingdoms&quot; is fully played by asians (normal, it&#39;s about their history...), and it&#39;s a GREAT movie.<br>And a character can also be black (or anything else...) without any problem, as long as it&#39;s an original character: &quot;Blade&quot;, for example, was always black in comics - like &quot;Black Panther&quot; BTW. Was it a problem? No. Were the movies good? Not so much, typical blockbuster/action movies, but they were praised anyway and were a box-office hit (first movie cost 45 M$, and total income was 131 M$, the lowest-grossing one was the third with &quot;only&quot; 65 M$ of BENEFITS). And we can say, &quot;despite a black, original hero who wasn&#39;t a remake of a successful white hero&quot;... Three movies, around 250 M$ of benefits, and an appreciated main - black - character.

3314,UgyYOe6OjuM-X21eT-14AaABAg,Xb2FKFL8vJ8,"So, I had posted (below) this to another YouTube channel discussing this very issue... I&#39;ll share my thoughts on this here. <br><br>&quot;This is the problem; it is not that Disney cannot make a successful movie; it is that Disney has lost its way in making new, original movies to highlight rising black women in the arts of acting. As for Halle Bailey being a lead actor in a Disney movie, I am absolutely sure she would have made a great original character [such as Tiana in &#39;Princess and the Frog].<br><br>However, Disney has lost it way in using Halle to portray her as &#39;Ariel&#39; in Little Mermaid; this will not be a successful movie just for this one fact [alone]. However, if Disney had any interest in creating a role and character around Halle to gain wide-spread acceptance, they should have done so [to the credit of all fans]. <br><br>Disney could have simply used Halle in a movie role of The Princess and Frog. This would have been a far better choice and a more likely successful role for Halle and Disney. But why Disney chose &#39;Little Mermaid&#39; is questionable, and it most certainly causes unnecessary discontent and disappointment to fans with Disney as a whole... at least in my opinion.  <br><br>If Disney&#39;s leaders think by causing controversy for political/social gains is their new model, it (so far) has shown time and time again that it does not work. Perhaps Disney&#39;s leaders like the hemorrhaging of economic collapse for tampering with old success. I for one think it is troubling and unnecessary.&quot;<br><br>Why Disney continues to do this is ridiculous; it is an insult to the characters they&#39;ve made over the decades... you cannot justify changing the identity of a well-established character just because it is the &#39;woke&#39; thing to do. But for Disney not trying to be original at all, it just destroys all that Disney once was and what it could be... Walt would be rolling in his grave. We&#39;d surely would not accept to change the identity of Tiana to become a white trans (male) Princess no more than we would accept Disney to change the identity of Mickey toward becoming a purple elephant -- Tiana is a Black Female and Mickey is a Black &amp; White male mouse... this is well established.  If, however, Disney wants to create a White Trans (male) into a Princess, then so be it, but create an original character to play the part. The same for a purple elephant. This too goes for Marvel and DC comic characters; don&#39;t change the identity of already existing Heros, just create new ones to play the &#39;woke&#39; parts.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
